# Why a Team Project

Team project aims to encourage students to get hands-on about their learning and conduct self-directing study and research. This is the area where we (the CESS team) can learn from you as well.

You only need to complete one of the two tracks on the team project: development track and non-development track.

# Development Track

This track is for developers and hackers who want to develop a full end-to-end application. It can be a web-app or a command line application (or any forms you are willing to bring forth). If you can code, we recommend you to pick this track.

The app has to connect to a smart contract, Substrate blockchain, or interacting with DeOSS API. So it can be:
  - ink! smart contract + web/cli client
  - Solidity smart contract + web/cli client
  - Substrate pallet code + web/cli client
  - DeOSS API + web/cli client

Number of team members allowed: 1 - 4 people

## Deliverable

- [Github repo](https://github.com/): an open source github repo.
- Deployed URL. If it is an application to be installed on a machine, the URL to download the installable binary.
- Deployed smart contract addresses, if applicable.
- A short writeup / demo video on what the project is aiming to achieve.

## Grading Rubric

Total 60%, composed of:

- Smart contract / pallet code / DeOSS API usage completion & elegance: 20%
- Frontend / client code completion and elegance: 20%
- Short writeup / demo video: 5%
- Team presentation: 15%

# Non-development Track

This track is for non-developers to get a better understanding in CESS architecture and web3 ecosystem overall. This is more like an open-ended mini-research on your chosen subject.

Based on [CESS whitepaper](https://docs.cess.cloud/core/readme/whitepaper), [CESS doc **Concepts** section](https://docs.cess.cloud/core/concepts), or the docs section in general, write on one of the following subjects:
   - a critique on the CESS architecture & tokenomics: where it can be improved and any potential weakness.
   - a proposal on the dApp you dream to build on top of CESS. If there is a frontend/client side, please include a sketch or low-fidelity mockups of the app.
   - a user experience report on using the CESS platform overall, it can be on the dApps, connecting to CESS chain, storing and retrieving object data via DeOSS, running the miner applications.

The writeup should be between 1,000 - 3,000 words.

Number of team members allowed: 1 - 2 people

## Deliverable

- A url directing to either the writeup online (any collaborating doc platform, without login), or where it can be downloaded.

Total 60%, composed of:

- Originality/Insight: 25%
- Writeup structure: 10%
- Writeup elegance: 10%
- Team presentation: 15%
